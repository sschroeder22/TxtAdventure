Cautiously you enter the ship's cabin. Clay jugs
called amphorae, once filled with oils and wines, are
strewn about. There are no remains of the crew.
You do have a sense of being in ancient Greece
and it is a strange feeling.
A door leads to a smaller cabin. On a table near
the rear of this cabin is a golden box. You open it
and find the remains of a map. It does not show
Atlantis. It shows that the ship was searching for a
hole that leads to the center of the earth!
You return to the Seeker and use the map to
locate this incredible shaft to the center of the
earth. Using some guesswork to interpret the map,
you discover the tunnel opening, which appears to
be roughly 100 feet in diameter. The sonar
readings indicate the hole has no bottom.

If you decide to descend into the hole,
press 1.

If you decide it is time to go
back up to the surface, press 2.

The trip back to the surface is smooth, and
finally the Seekeris hauled aboard the Maray. You
climb out and are greeted by the scientists and
crew. The Seeker is prepared for the second dive,
but suddenly the wind rises and the sea kicks up
into furious waves that crash over the deck of the
Maray. All hands rush to prepare for hurricane
force winds. There is no chance for the second
dive to begin. All day and all night the Maray
pitches on the stormy sea.
The next morning the wind has died and the sky
clear. You are now ready to dive again.

Again the Seeker is lowered over the side of the
Maray and slipsinto the ocean. Fish swim by peering cautiously at you in your metal shell. The sunlight fades as you descend into the abyss.
You are headed for the giant canyon below that
might lead to Atlantis. When you reach the canyon
you switch on the Seeker's searchlight. Immediately you spot the round hole that appears to
be made by intelligent beings. Perhaps it leads to
Atlantis.

A helicopter is sent to pick you up and return
you to an air base for a flight back to the United
States. Newspaper reports indicate that the search
for Atlantis has been given up. Several months
later, however, a group of scientists get in touch
with you because they believe that Atlantis can be
found. They have put together another expedition
and want you to join it. You are tempted. Adventure into the unknown is what you like.

You decide to guide the Seeker into the new
passageway to the bubble source. Suddenly the
Seeker is swept downward as if pulled by a giant
magnet. You lose consciousness. When you
awake, you are in a well-lighted and comfortable
room. Three people are standing close to you.
They look normal and appear to be friendly.
The middle one speaks. "You are in the nether
region of Atlantis. Thisis a visitors'reception room.
If you wish to come into the city of Atlantis, then
follow us; but you may never return to your world.
If you wish to leave now, we will escort you safely
to the surface. It is your choice. We do not wish to
harm you."

You suddenly realize the stream of bubbles is
powerful enough to raise the Seeker. You guide
the Seeker into the bubble stream and it heads
towards the surface. As you swirl upward, you
begin to notice increasing amounts of brown
kelpâ€” seaweed. Near the surface, you become
entangled in the seaweed. The instruments in the
Seeker indicate that the propellers and the steering
mechanisms will not work.
You put on your sea suit and go out to see what
can be done. Once outside in the kelp, you realize
that you can't free the Seeker. You start to swim
for the surface but then you are soon completely
stuck in the clinging seaweed. You are trapped and
unable to go forward or return to the Seeker.

towards the surface, press 1.

You are led to a room. The floors are a rich
marble. The walls glow. The ceiling is like being
inside a diamond looking through the many facets.
A person who immediately commands respect
beckons you with firmness and kindness to come
to her.
"Welcome to Atlantis. Thousands of years ago
we learned that we were about to slip into the sea.
Our people prepared for the calamity by building a
new city inside an extinct volcano. We have lived
here in peace and harmony ever since. We have
no sunlight, nor stars to gaze at, but we have other
spaces to meditate upon."
She tells you about a group of people called the
Nodoors. If you wish, you can live with them, but
you cannot leave Atlantis.
A bearded man is to be your escort. Atlantis is a
beautiful city. Buildings merge one into another,
colors radiate light, and coral branches fill courtyards.
There is a sense of well-being and peace.
It would be pleasant here, but you don't want to
be a prisoner. Maybe there would be a better
chance to escape if you join the Nodoors. You ask
your guide about them.
"Oh, we believe they are dangerous, but we
don't really know. They live in the center of the old
volcano. If you wish, I can take you there."

If you decide to join the Nodoors,
press 1.
If you decide to remain with
the Atlanteans and perhaps get a
chance to escape, press 2.

The Atlanteans have lived in peace for thousands
of years. They have no love of warfare. Their
civilization is technologically very advanced and a
sensing mechanism tells them that you are about
to use your laser cannon. They quickly fire a special beam at the Seeker that makes all its functions
stop. You are now powerlessto escape. They walk
up calmly to the Seeker and tell you to come with
them to Atlantis.
"You are now part of Atlantis. We understand
your fear, but do not be frightened. No harm will
come to you and your life will be full. Follow us."
As you walk with them, into a new world, you
wonder if you will ever see the sky again.

You escape being seen by the submarine craft.
Following the instructions you enter a passage way.
At the end of the passageway is an airlock
door and beyond it an incredibly large air-filled
cavern. Perhaps it is the inside of an extinct volcano.
The land is pleasant, although strange to your
experience. A softsubstance covers the ground. It
seems to be alive. You can't tell. A gentle light
comes from the sides of this huge cavern.
It reminds you of early morning light just before the
sun rises.
A group of people approach you with friendly
gestures. They are wearing simple clothes much
like the clothes people wore in ancient Greece.
They are kind and generous. You remove your
diving suit to find that the air is good to breathe.
These people speak a language that is unknown
to you, but one of them acts as an interpreter. You
find out that this is Atlantis. They tell you it is
governed by a man who is greedy, selfish, and
dangerous. The people are like slaves. Everyone is
unhappy except a few who serve the ruler as his
lieutenants. These new friends ask for your help.
Perhaps you can help them escape.

Quickly you get into the Seeker in an attempt to
escape the strange submarine. You notice that the
sub is chasing you so you put on full emergency
ascent power. You could use your laser cannon to
blast the sub, but you do not wish to hurt anyone.
The ascent towardsthe surface isswift, but a few
fathoms from the surface all systems on the Seeker
fail. You are suspended in the water in a helpless
position. It seems that a mysterious force has disabled you.

You are greeted by a group of people who look
like ordinary human beings except that there are
gill-like slits on their necks. Their bare feet have
skin between the toes forming a web. They order
you to put on your sea suit, pull you quickly from
the Seeker, and lead you towards their city. On the
way they show you the zoo where there are animals from the world above the sea. There is a
glass-like cage surrounding them filled with air,
allowing them to live below the sea.

Back aboard the Seeker, you radio the Maray
that you are surfacing to make a plan. While rising
out of the giant crevice-like canyon, you spot what
appears to be a road running along the top of the
ledge. What is this? The scientists aboard the
Maray had mentioned the possibilities of finding
signs of the ancient civilization, such asroads. You
must investigate.
