With great sorrow, you decide that it is wisest to
leave the expedition now. You can't risk returning
to the great depths below. So, you reluctantly
return to the United States.
You are invited to tell of your adventures on
several major television shows. While on one such
show, a special news flash announces to the world
the discovery of Atlantis. You regret your decision,
but you didn't really have a choice. Did you?

You can't resist the adventure beneath the sea.
You must go down again, and after several weeks
of rest, you enter the Seeker and slip quickly into
the deep. You bring the Seeker to rest by the great
canyon in the ocean bottom and, wearing your
special suit, you venture out into the depths. There
are no signs of the giant squid and you feel safe.
Rounding a rock formation, you come upon the
wreck of an ancient Greek ship. How strange to
find this ship, intact, so far below the surface. What
brought it here? Was it visiting Atlantis before the
lost continent slipped beneath the sea?
You take pictures and make notes in your special undersea book. Maybe this ancient ship hides
the secret to Atlantis.

the Greek ship, press 1.

If you return to the surface to
report your findings, press 2.

The dolphin looks at you, and you even imagine
that he is smiling at you. You grab one of his
flippers and with a powerfulswitch of his body, the
dolphin swims upward. In a short time, you break
through to the surface. You blink in the brightsun.
The Maray is nowhere in sight. You are lost far at
sea.
The dolphin dives beneath the surface with you
still clinging to him. He speeds off and within 20
minutes you are next to the Moray. The dolphin
must have heard the Moray's engine noises underneath the water.
Once aboard, everyone congratulates you on
your escape. You will go down again, but the
thought keeps haunting you: What if your luck has
run out?

the next day, press 1.

the expedition, press 2.

The dolphin might help and might not. You
decide to chance it alone. So, up you head, swimming towards the surface. The dolphin follows for
some time, and then swims off. You rest for awhile
about 300 feet below the surface before your final
ascent.
Then a large fishâ€” ugly, lumpy, puffed up, and
covered with black and white markings swims towards you. Its bulging eyes fasten on you. It is a
big-mouthed grouper, a fish which does not
bother to bite its victims, butsimply swallowsthem
whole.
It looks as though you are its next meal.

You are able to capture the bubbling gases and
fill the tanks of the Seeker, enough to allow it to
rise. Slowly, the Seeker rises out of the canyon,
scattering schools of brightly colored fish, and
brushing past underwater plants that wave like
palm trees in a wind. Just as you reach the ledge at
the top of the canyon, you see what appears to be
an old road! Rocks along its side seem to be guard
rails. Could this be a path that leads to the lost city
of Atlantis? You anchor the Seeker and prepare to
investigate more closely.

    As you begin to drill, the stream of bubbles
increases.
    The stream of bubbles is strong enough now to
ruffle the surface of the sea. You could try to
surface now and locate the exact position of the
bubble area. Then you could make plans with the
scientists aboard the Moray about what to do next.
But also, you could simply explore the hole with
the Seeker to determine the source of the bubbles
now! There is great risk in entering the hole, but it
could lead to the source of the bubbles and maybe
to Atlantis.

If you explore, press 1.

If you try to surface, press 2.

    Now is the time for decision. You check all the
controls of the Seeker, grit your teeth, and push
the control column into the deep dive position.
Down, down you go where no person has ever
ventured. The Seeker is built for deep, deep dives,
but you are descending rapidly mile after mile into
the deep. The pressure is intense, the darkness is
complete, and the depth guage indicates an incredible 15 miles. You quickly reverse the control
column. Warning lights flare up on your control
panel; they show that gravitational forces are now
stronger than the Seeker's propulsion motors. You
have passed the point of no return and your journey downward will continue in utter darkness until
the water pressure is too great for the Seeker. This
is the final voyage.

    Deciding to return to the surface, you direct the
Seeker cautiously back along the side of the canyon in the ocean floor. Without warning, the
Seekeris gripped in a powerful current thatsweeps
it toward a grotto. Once in the grotto, the current
carries you to what appears to be a large metal
door. It swings open and the Seeker is swept inside. The door closes, the water in the grotto drains
away, and you step out into a chamber that you
decide must be made by human hands.
    A door opens in the wall, two people dressed in
simple clothes come towards you. One of them
says, "Welcome to Atlantis. We have been expecting you."
    What a discovery! You have found the lost continent and its civilization. The two people tell you
that although citizens of Atlantis occasionally journey to the upper world, anyone who happens
upon Atlantis is never permitted to leave. The
Atlanteans are not cruel but fear discovery of their
world.
    They want you to follow them and you agree.
But you have another thought. Perhaps you could
blast your way out of the chamber with the
Seeker's laser cannon.

join the Atlantean society, press 1.

    The submarine is indeed mysterious. You now
have on your sea suit and you open the hatch on
the conning tower and enter the sub. It is amazingly clean and in order. There are no signs of life,
but there are also no signs ofstruggle or trouble. In
the control room, you see a piece of mystifying
equipment that just doesn't belong on this sub.
    A voice begins telling you that, thousands of
years ago, the leaders of Atlantis realized that their
continent was slipping into the sea. They discovered a large underground cavern and built new
forms of living quarters for their people. Later
when Atlantis was deep beneath the ocean, some
of their scientists discovered and perfected an operation enabling them to breathe under water.
    The voice, which sounds friendly, also tells you
that there are two groups in Atlantis. One group is
good and the other is evil. The voice invites you to
enter the world of Atlantis and gives directions and
instructions to a secret passageway to the underwater city.
    As you follow directions, you spy an unbelievable underwater craft with several people in it. It
must be an Atlantean ship, but are the people
good or evil? Do they know of the secret passageway?

the secret passageway without being seen,

    You cruise through the grotto past the wreck of
the submarine and then you spot another ship
wreck. And then another. They, too, are covered
with algae, but they appear undamaged. Maybe
people from Atlantis capture ships in the Bermuda
Triangle and bring them here. Then you see
another ship, but this one is a three-masted
schooner of the type used in the early 1800s. Its
rigging isfestooned with algae, and fish swim lazily
around its mast.
    Your curiosity captures you and you put on your
sea suit. Leaving the Seeker, you move towards
the old sailing ship. Suddenly a thirteen-foot long
deadly poisonous sea snake strikes from behind
the forward cabin and bites you in the soft flesh
between the fingers of your right hand. There is no
antidote to the deadly poison.

    The only way to get beyond the door isto blast it
away, or so you believe. The Seeker's laser cannon is powerful and you position the Seeker to fire.
Pushing the fire button, you send a powerful beam
at the hatch. Nothing happens. Then you advance
the cannon control to full emergency force. Again
you push the button and the beam dissolves the
hatch instantly. A flood ofsea water rushesinto the
giant hole, carrying you with it into an air-filled
cavern beyond. The water fills the cavern with
speed and explosive force. You see several people
scurrying towards escape hatches. IT IS TOO
LATE! You did the wrong thing.

the doorsuddenly swings open revealing behind it
a cavern with another door. You enter the cavern
cautiously and receive a radio signal in English. It
