This is too much for you. It is like a nightmare
and you decide to turn back. But going back is
much harder than you expected. The electrons
whirl closer and closer to you as though they were
guards keeping you from leaving. It is difficult to
guide the Seeker in this maze of atoms. The instruments are useless now. The figures of the Atlanteans disappear. Suddenly, you are caught in
the elastic membrane that almost stopped you
before. It sticks to the Seeker, holding you back.
You want to be free and return to the world you
have known all your life.
You lose consciousness and wake up several
hours later in your sea suit floating above the hole
in the ocean floor. The Seeker is gone. You're
dazed: did you dream the whole thing? Slowly you
return to the surface, but the Maray has disappeared. You can't decide how much time has
elapsed. You realize that your crew must think you
are lost forever and you know they are right. The
waves rock your unresisting body back and forth
as you float alone in the vast sea. You feel your
strength slowly draining away.

A thought traveler! You realize that people do it
all the time in day dreams. Of course, you want to
be a thought traveler, but how?
The Atlanteans speak softly and tell you that all
things are the sameâ€” past, present, future are all
the same. It simply requires you to concentrate
and put your thoughts where you wish them to be.
You try, and amazingly you are rapidly rushed
through time to the day you were born, then to the
day you made your first deep-sea dive. Your mind
flies from one time in your life to another. But
when it comesto the future, you meet a blank wall.
You can't seem to travel into the future.
"Why can't I travel ahead in time," you ask the
Atlanteans.
"Be patient," they reply. "All in good time."
Suddenly you whirl through time into the outer
reaches of the universe where you can actually feel
the light going through you. You cast no shadow.
A sense of peace fills you.

The reflected energy is damaging to your craft.

You have a laser pistol that you carry for
emergencies. You blast a hole in the whirlpool wall
and dive through it. Facing you is a school of fish
who are puzzled by this strange intruder. Behind
them lurks the form of a shark. You swim toward
the surface slowly and the shark vanishes into the
deep.
The Maray is nowhere in sight. You are wondering how long you'll be waiting when a loud splashing sighing sound startles you. A huge whale has
surfaced and lies nearby spouting and sucking in
great noisy draughts of air. It take you a good half
hour to swim to the enormous creature. It pays no
attention to you. You climb onto its tail and crawl
on hands and knees toward the highest point of its
back. It's like creeping up a gigantic grey rock.
From your vantage point on top, sure enough,
you can see the Moray and the tiny glint of binocular lenses reflecting in the sun. The Maray crew is
watching the whale. You wave, feeling certain they
have seen you. It won't be long before they come
to collect you.

You faint, and when you come to, you are
floating on the surface of the ocean. There is a
heavy ocean swell and the sun beats down on you.
The whirlpool must have stopped as quickly and
mysteriously as it began. You feel dizzy and
exhausted and you move gently to make sure you
haven't broken any bones. As you move your
head slowly inside your helmet, you feel an intense
pain shooting across your right temple. You have
to lie very still then and gradually your ears pick up
the thrum of the search helicopter. You don't dare
move to look, but as the minutes go by, the thrum
gets louder and slowly disappears. The helicopter
has passed over you. It won't return this way. The
pain in your temple increases. You begin to lose
consciousness.

The walls of the whirlpool look like solid ridges
sloping upwards to the surface. The water is rushing so fast that the center looks absolutely calm.
You wonder if perhaps you could swim up through
that calm. It's worth a try, and you set off. Before
you can tell if you're making any progress, the
whirlpool reverses and instead of whirling down, it
whirls up and catapults you out of the ocean and
into the air. You fall back onto the surface of the
ocean close to the Maray. Although you are
stunned by the fall, you quickly gain your senses
and are picked up by the ship. Of course no one
