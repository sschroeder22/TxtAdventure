Over 1000 years of thought travel later, you are
called into the main thinking room. You are told
that you may now return to earth life. You have
doubts about going back, but you are curious to
see what changes have occurred while you were
living in Atlantis.
What a sight greets you as you circle earth at an
altitude of 1000 feet! The great cities of the world,
New York, London, Paris, and Hong Kong are
overgrown with vegetation. The roadsleading into
the cities are barely visible. But you see signs of
new settlements. There are clusters of buildings
spread out in the countryside. You don't see any
smokestacks. There are few roads and no cars.
The people live a simple life providing themselves
with food, shelter, and clothing. You wish to join
them.

You just can't give up your body. It might be all
right for the Atlanteans to move about as pure
energy, but you have not reached a point where
you are willing to risk what you are for what they
are.
It isstrange wandering about with bright glowing
blobs of energy moving with you. They ask you to
give talks about life on earth as you know it, and
you agree. For two years you meet with the Atlanteans in their energy forms and talk about earth
and how people live and what they do. The Atlanteans are interested in all aspects of earth life: the
technology, politics, wars, and religion.
You ask them why, but they never give you a
direct answer. Then one day you look down at
yourself and you only see bright, glowing energy.
With horror you realize you have become one of
them.

You are in the Atlantean world; why not become like
an Atlantean? Looking down at your
hands, you see them gradually begin to glow with
a warm, yellow light. Little by little, the glow travels
up your arms and legs until suddenly you have no
body left. You are a glowing energy form. You feel
a sense of freedom and happiness that you have
never known before. You can float, or fly, or zoom
anywhere you want to. No wallsstop you; you just
melt through them. You don't need food or rest.
You can travel through time, and you can travel
instantly back to earth in your energy form.
You feel that this is the way you want to be.

Farming under the sea is a job that you enjoy.
Outside Atlantis, there are fields of sea plants that
are worked on just like gardens above the sea.
Atlanteans go out each day and harvest the plants,
take care of the fields, and chase away the fish that
love to nibble on the growing plants. Then there
are fish pens to work on. There you feed and tend
the fish until they are needed for food. Farming
under the sea is beautiful and it is much easier than
you had imagined. Danger lurks, though, in the
form of sting rays, slender sea snakes, and occasional sharks. You have to be on your guard at all
times.

A musician in the world of Atlantis. Who would
believe it? You are asked to choose an instrument
to play. You examine water lutes,sea drums,shark
bone flutes, and a wide range of electronic instruments. You choose one of the electronic instruments, but it makes no sound at all. You are told
that it plays music that people feel rather than hear.
What a world you're living in! Who would believe
in music that is not heard? Gradually you learn to
feel the different notes with parts of your body:
your thighs, chest, temples, and fingertips. Your
interest in this new way of sensing music grows
with each day. You master this new art form. You
become their greatest musician.

These people lead you to a control room. There
you meet the commander of an underwater scientific center that is conducting secret research into
life underneath the sea. They inform you that it
was a good thing that you did not use your laser
cannon, because they have anti-laser devices that
would have blown you and the Seeker to pieces.
After a pleasant meal and a tour of the deepwater lab, you are sent back to the Seeker for a
return journey to the surface. You are told never to
return again; if you do, you will be kept a prisoner
for the rest of your life.

When you refuse to follow them, they take out
small hand-held hypnotizers that put you into a
deep trance. You are led through a long tunnel
into a large underwater lab. Three military technicians come up to you and break the trance.
"You have stumbled into a secret military base.
We're developing too many secret plans to risk
being discovered. You will remain our prisoner."
There is no escape.
