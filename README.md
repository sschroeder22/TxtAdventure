# TxtAdventure
Journey Under The Sea by R.A. Montgomery

Run TxtAdv.py or AdvQAB.py to play

I didn't bother making a way to quit part way through.

I haven't proof read the questions so there is probably
some missing spaces and things like that.

I explained in the examples file instead of doing comments
because I didn't feel like going over it.

Also I don't know how to make AdvQ and Var subfolders without
a lot of work so its a little messy.
