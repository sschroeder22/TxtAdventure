Why not go? Who would believe it? The center
of the earth! You push the control column forward
and dive deep. Soon there is no more water, just a
heavy gas that acts like water. You look at a world
of colors and drifting forms. You pass by layers of
rock and sand. Suddenly you sail into a gooey
mass which almost fouls the Seeker's propellers.
Then the Seeker's engine stops and you are pulled
along through the semi-liquid material by something like gravity or magnetism. You burst through
a thick elastic membrane and enter an area of giant
atoms. Electrons whirl around you at high speed,
but there is plenty of room to maneuver between
these fast-moving particles. The electrons are revolving around a small mass you know is called the
nucleus. You are able to avoid collisions with the
electrons. What a world! Maybe you are having
hallucinations.

You face the fact that it is too dangerous to dive

You give one last look at the opening, check the
Seeker's instruments and head up to the surface.
Finally the Seeker breaks through into fresh air

The three people lead you into an enormous
cavern. In the center of the cavern is a huge,
silver-colored machine. It isshaped like a long tube
with several round panels attached to one end.
They lead you inside. It is the most advanced
control room that you have everseen. Computers,
sensing devices, recording devices, monitors, and
a host of dials and panels fill the room. A strangely
shaped figure with a very large head and totally
blank eyes faces you.
"So, now you are in the control room of Atlantis. You see our secret. We landed on this planet
3000 years ago. We used our anti-matter device to

The three people of Atlantis sense your wish to
return to the surface. Instantly, they produce a
bubble-shaped capsule and put you inside.
"Farewell, earth person. May you live a long
and prosperous life."
You shoot up swiftly through the sea and break
out onto the surface near the Maray. The capsule
that protected you disintegrates upon reaching the
surface. Once aboard the Maray, you tell the crew
and the scientists about your adventure. They are
kind to you, but no one believes you. They think
you have imagined the world of Atlantis as a result
of being so deep for so long.
Back in the United States, you begin a television

It doesn't take you long to find the king. One of
his countless agents leads you to him. He is in a
small simple room with a strange light glowing
from the rounded ceiling.
"So, you have found your way here after all. Put
your mind at rest. I won't hurt you." The king's
booming voice startles you. He invites you to sit

After several hours with the king, you find him to

The problem is where do they escape to? The

The best plan is to wait until the Maray locates
you with sonar equipment. You can't signal the
ship because none of the Seeker's electronic
equipment is working. There is no sign of the
mysterious submarine. Perhaps it has left, now
that you have been chased away from the world of
Atlantis.
Looking out of the thick glass porthole, you see
a giant blue whale heading for you. It looks as
though the whale is going to ram you. Maybe the
other submarine has angered the whale and it is
seeking revenge on any craft near it.
Suddenly the whale hits you full force. The
Seeker is badly damaged. Water begins to trickle
in through the hatch cover. You must abandon the

There is one way out, you decide. Leave the
Seeker and try to reach the surface on your own.
You enter the airlock chamber which gives you
access to the ocean. With a quick push off, you
leave the Seeker and swim towards the surface. A
small, yellow life raft is part of your escape equipment. The surface of the sea is calm, but the Maray
is nowhere in sight.
For 2 days and nights you drift in the life raft
under hot sun and sharp starlight. At last a search

A large white lightshines down on you as you lie

occupy your mind. When you awake, you feel no
pain nor any real change. But, now you can
breathe underwater and join the Atlanteans in
their world.
For several weeks you explore the world under
the sea as you never have seen it before. Without
the heavy oxygen equipment on your back, you
feel a marvelous sense of energy and you glide

The Atlanteans try to convince you that life with

refuse. Sadly they give up their arguments and
spray you with a special mist that immediately
knocks you out. Several hours later you gain your

air tank where you breathe naturally. Your closest
neighbor is a horse who looks at you with sorrow

small apartment very much like the ones in the
world above the sea. People come by and look at
you and talk with you.
