The electrons whirl about at dizzy speeds and
you continue until you get to a spot where your
instruments indicate that there is no time. The

beautiful music and see lights that you feel and
taste as well. Peace and well-being fill you.
You become aware of other beings close to you.
No one has entered through the only hatch and yet
there are other presences in the Seeker. Turning
around, you see three Atlanteans. Then you feel
that the Seeker has become just a thought and that
the people from Atlantis have entered your mind

No, you will not dive down toward the center of

you think that your sonar gear is probably not
working correctly. The hole is deep, but you don't

the earth. Caution is your approach. You go back
to the surface to consult with the scientists aboard
the Moray.
The scientiststell you that their instruments have
been damaged, perhaps by an approaching storm,

the Maray away from the site of the mysterious
