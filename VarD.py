    With a rush of water, the giant squid attacks you.
Two 20 foot tentacles with their pulsing suction
cups reach out trying to ensnare you. You dive off
the platform and rapidly fire two of your spears.
They strike the squid close to its two monstrous
eyes. But the squid keeps on coming.
    One of the tentacles wraps around your diving
helmet and ruptures the seal to your suit. You fire
your last spear hoping to hit the monster in a
vulnerable spot. Water is beginning to trickle into
your suit. You signal the Maray to haul you up
fast— "Emergency Hoist." You must have hit the
squid. It floats away writhing and thrashing. You
think you're about to black out.
    You wake up on the deck of the Moray and are
quickly rushed to the decompression chambers to
ward off the effect of the bends. In a few days you
are better and start to worry about diving into the
abyss again.


If you decide to quit the
expedition now, press 1.

If you decide to go back down to
the deep, press 2.
 """

qA1B1C2D = """
    As they begin the rapid hauling, you lose your
ability to function in the deep. You start to get dizzy
and your arms and legs feel weak. You lose your
hold on the platform and drift in the water
exhausted. Then you see a dolphin heading toward you. You know that these marvelous
mammalssometimes help people in trouble. Will it
help you?

If you try to get help from
the dolphin, press 1.

If you decide to carry
on alone swimming to the
surface, press 2.
"""

qA1B2C1D = """
    You fire the special propulsion charge and zoom
upward through the water, frightening schools of
fish as you go. You become dizzy and lose track of
where you are. The world seems upside down.
The shark is nowhere around, you hope. Then
you break through to the surface floating about a
half mile from the Maray.
    The lookouts spot you in the water and quickly
rescue you. Unfortunately, the rapid ascent has
given you a bad case of the bends. It takes a long
time to decompress. And when you are finally all
right, the ship's doctor informs you that your
underwater days are over. Someone else will have
to find Atlantis.

The End
"""

qA1B2C2D = """
    You wait for the shark to go away. But then you
notice other sharks coming to join in the hunt.
They circle you, coming closer and faster each
time. It is too late. There is no escape!

The End
 """

qA2B1C1D = """
    You squeeze into your sea suit and, outside the
Seeker, you use special equipment to analyze the
bubbles. As you work, you clumsily knock against
the valve that dumpsthe compressed air necessary
to make the Seeker rise to the surface. There is
nothing to be done about it; so you continue to
analyze the bubbles. They contain a high percentage of oxygen and no poisonous gases. Perhaps
they are coming from some area below the sea
where human-type beings can live and breathe.
Perhaps they are coming from Atlantis.
    You wonder whether you should try the
Seeker's drilling arm to enlarge the source of the
bubbles so you can explore it with the Seeker. But
you are also very worried about the Seeker's loss
of rising capability. You might also be able to trap
the bubbles and use them to raise the Seeker.

If you try to collect the bubbles
coming from the hole to fill the tanks
of the Seeker, press 1.

If you decide to drill, press 2.
 """

qA2B1C2D = """
    You maneuver the Seeker next to the hole and
begin to take sonar readings to determine the
depth of the hole. To your amazement, the sonar
readings indicate that the hole is extraordinarily
deep— it might reach the center of the earth!
    What lies down there? Where are the bubbles
coming from? Is Atlantis beneath you?
    Then you notice a disturbing reading on your
instruments; a mild earthquake has occurred. The
Seeker is not damaged, but the earthquake could
set up a tsunami wave on the surface causing the
Moray to leave forsafer areas. It might be
dangerous not to get back to the surface and leave with
the Moray. On the other hand, you are perhaps on
the verge of one of the world's greatest discoveries.

If you decide to descend into the hole,
press 1.

If you decide to return to the surface,
press 2.

    The beam from the laser light illuminates the
entire grotto. Far back on the floor of the grotto is a
submarine! Cautiously, you maneuver the Seeker
closer. You identify it asthe submarine that mysteriously
disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle almost a year before.
The Bermuda Triangle is more than 2000 miles away.
    The submarine is apparently not damaged, but
it is covered with a slimy algae. Beautiful fish swim
around it as though it is their own special prize.
Then you notice that the main hatch is free of
algae!

If you decide to try
to enter the submarine,
press 1.
If you decide to cruise on through
the grotto, press 2.
"""

qA2B2C2D = """
    You cruise silently into the grotto. Its roof seems
to slope upward and you follow the slope. The
depth finder shows that you are rising quite
rapidly. Perhaps you will reach the surface and
open air. Then the roof of the grotto stops sloping
upward. Before you is a perfectly round metallic
hatch made of a metal that you have never seen
before. With the mechanical arm of the Seeker
you try to open the hatch. It will not open. You
begin to send radio signals at the door hoping to
make contact on the other side.

If you decide to blow the hatch open
with an explosive charge,
press 1.

If you decide to continue
transmitting radio communications through the hatch, press 2.
