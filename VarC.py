    The giant squid tosses and turnsthe Seeker, but
finally the creature growstired of its new game and
jets off with an enormous squirt of water. You now
are free to leave your hiding place and examine
the Seeker for damage.
    To your dismay, the airlock entrance has been
jammed shut. You are locked out of the Seeker.
The crew of the Maray, however, suspected trouble when
 you did not respond to a routine radio check and they are
  now lowering an escape platform to you. Once on the platform,
you radio them to start the slow pull to the surface. To avoid the
bends—rapid expansion of nitrogen bubbles in
your blood—they will have to bring you up very
slowly.
    Just as the platform begins to move, the giant
squid suddenly returns as if from nowhere. It is
headed directly at you.

If you decide to fight the squid
with yourspear gun, hoping to scare
it off, press 1.

If you decide to signal Maray to pull
you up at top speed, knowing you will
get the bends, press 2.

    Moving cautiously, you climb up the sides of the
canyon hoping to reach the ocean floor. You leave
the Seekerin the grips of the giantsquid. Your plan
is to signal for help with a dye marker that will float
to the surface and make a bright yellow patch in
the water. The crewmen above have been instructed to watch
for such emergency signals. They will send help.
    Once you reach the ledge above the canyon
and feel slightiy safer, you see the most feared of all
sea creatures— a huge shark. It begins to circle
towards you and you know that you are its target.
You wonder whether you should fire your
emergency propulsion charge that will send you
rapidly to the surface. The shark is fast; he might
catch you anyway. You also know that you will get
the bends from the rapid rise to the surface.

If you decide to fire the special
propulsion charge to get to the surface,
press 1.

If you decide to wait quietly
hoping that the shark will go away,
press 2.

    Carefully, you maneuver the Seeker between
the walls of the canyon.
    On the floor of the canyon, you discover a large
round hole out of which flow the large bubbles.
The Seeker is equipped with scientific equipment
to analyze the bubbles. It also has sonar equipment that
can measure the depth of any hole.

If you decide to analyze the bubbles,
press 1.

If you decide to take sonar readings,
press 2.

qA2B2C = """
    You pilot the Seeker through the rounded entrance
to the grotto. Once inside, your searchlight
picks up what appear to be docks and piers along
the grotto walls. The Seeker's searchlight is not
very powerful. However, you do have a special
laser light which would light up the grotto like
daylight. Unfortunately, the laser light can only be
used twice for very short periods before it must be
recharged aboard the Maray, now more than
2,000 feet above you on the surface.

If you decide to use the laser light,
press 1.

If you decide to cruise further into
the grotto, press 2.
